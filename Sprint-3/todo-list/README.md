# ToDo List App

The files in this folder implements a ToDo List App that allows a user to
- Create a new ToDo task
- Delete a ToDo task
- Display all ToDo tasks
- Changing the "completed" status of a ToDo task

Each ToDo task has two properties:
  - `task`: A string describing the task 
  - `completed`: a Boolean value that indicates whether the task is completed or not 

## Installation

To view the website, open `index.html` with Live Server in VS Code.

**Note**: The app is loaded **as ES modules** in the HTML file, and as such, the HTML file must be accessed via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol.

## Understanding how the code is organized as ES modules

## Instructions

In this exercise, your objective is to extend the ToDo app by implementing new features. 
Start with the main feature and then try the stretch goals if you have extra time.

### Main Feature: Mass delete of completed ToDos

Add a button that deletes all completed tasks at once.

Steps:
1. In `index.html`, add a "Delete completed tasks" button.

2. In `todos.mjs`, implement a function `deleteCompleted(todoList)` that removes all completed 
   ToDos from the given list.

3. In `todos.test.mjs`, write a Jest test that verifies `deleteCompleted()` works correctly.

4. In `script.js`, call `deleteCompleted()` whenever the new button is clicked.
    - ⚠️ You should not need to modify the `render()` function.

### Stretch 1: Add deadlines for ToDos

Allow users to set and view deadlines for their tasks.
    - When creating a ToDo, let the user select a deadline using an HTML **datepicker** input.
    - If no date is selected, the ToDo has **no deadline**.
    - When rendering a ToDo in the list, display the deadline only if it exists.

### Stretch 2: Extra Challenge – Show time remaining

Instead of showing the deadline as a date, display how many days are left until the 
deadline (relative to today).
    - Decide how overdue ToDos should be handled and then implement your chosen solution.

👉 Hint: You can use the [JavaScript Date API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date)
to calculate the difference.
