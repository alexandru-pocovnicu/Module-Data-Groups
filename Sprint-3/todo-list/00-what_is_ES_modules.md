# What is JavaScript Modules?
JavaScript modules let us organize code into separate files, making the code easier to manage and reuse. We can export parts of one file (like functions or variables) and import them into another to keep our code clean and modular.

## Different Module Systems

JavaScript has two main ways to handle modules:

- **CommonJS** is the older format used mostly in Node.js. It uses `require` and `module.exports`.

- **ES Modules** (ESM) are the modern, standard way for browsers and Node.js. They use `import` and `export`.

They are **not** fully compatible. At CYF, you should use ESM, not CommonJS.
